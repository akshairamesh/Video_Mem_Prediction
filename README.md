# MediaEval-Media-Memorability
Used Neural networks and Deep Learning models to predict the memorability of videos. CNN, MLP and RNN were used as part of this work.

#Code Implementation
The implementation was done in Google Colab. 

#Attached Report 
The report on this task :- Video_mem_asgmt.pdf

#Output 
Step 1 : Change the path for os.chdir if needed, as of now its in :  os.chdir("/content/drive/My Drive/CA684_Assignment/")

Step 2 : Run the code cells one by one in the memorability.ipynb file for preprocessing and training the models.

Step 3 : After training a model, run the prediction cells at the end of notebook and then run the corresponding code cell for result.

Step 4 : Repeat step 3 for each model.
